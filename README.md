# **Moodify**
### Inspiration
During tough times such as Hackathon's no sleep running or a global pandemic, stress levels tend to rise and affect our daily lives. Moreover, smartwatches are pretty popular nowadays and can monitor and track a comprehensive set of human-physical features and thus, evaluate the stress levels in near real-time. Furthermore, another cause for high-stress levels is news, combined with a crisisâ€¦ guess what's next?

### What it does
We're introducing a new way to experience news reading, taking care of reducing your stress levels. By monitoring the user's data and tracking his human-physical features measured by smartwatches and their preferences, "Moodify" recommends the news suitable to the user's stress levels.

### How we built it
We developed a web application and a sophisticated backend using state-of-the-art technology, which involves data analytics, a machine learning algorithm for continuous learning, and profiling user behavior, offering a way to lower its stress levels. Furthermore, NLP techniques, such as sentiment analysis, entities recognition, text similarities to the rescue. We also integrated with given on-site Garmin watch for measuring the person's stress levels.

### Challenges we ran into
The big challenge was how to make successful predictions using small, tagged data that we managed to train using the Garmin smartwatch.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Managed to complete a PoC Involves user interface, backend, and integration with smartwatch API to get reasonable predictions.

### What we learned
Working with real-time data, integrating with smartwatch API, and learning algorithms and data visualizations using the d3.js library.

### What's next for Moodify
Integration with more smartwatches, going mobile to use the real-time SDK of Garmin, Improving the algorithm's results with more data that we will train continually on more users. Using Reinforcement Learning models for improving personalization.
